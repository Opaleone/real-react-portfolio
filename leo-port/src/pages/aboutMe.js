        <p id='bio'>Hello! My name is Leone Varando. I am a Full Stack Web developer who had experience creating
        projects with HTML-CSS, JavaScript, React.JS, and much more.<br></br><br></br>I have many hobbies outside of my programming career as well. One such hobby is music production. I like to
        create music
        as well as listen to it regularly. Another hobby of mine is FPV drone flying. This is a hobby I have acquired
        recently and
        really enjoy as it makes me feel as though I am flying!<br></br><br></br>
        I've began pursuing coding to jumpstart my career into something that gives me satisfaction in life as well as
        give me the ability
        to connect with others in a special way. I will get to create things for others, inspire others, and teach
        others through a
        medium that will quickly become something everyone will have to have a profiency in at some point.</p>
